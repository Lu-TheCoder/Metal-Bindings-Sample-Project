# Metal-Bindings-Sample-Project
This is my initial attempt to create C Metal-Bindings to use Metal purely in C..

## Issues
- Memory Leaks!
  
For some reason we leaking memeory and we cant seem to free the resources as enabling "ARC" doesnt do much in a C environment and manually freeing the objects, seem like not doing much either to reduce the memory leaks on each Frame update in the game loop
